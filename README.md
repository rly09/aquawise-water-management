# 🌊 AquaWise – Smart Water Management System

### 🚀 Submitted for: Sustainovation 2025 – Clean Water Track  
### 📌 Problem Statement 3:  
*How can we design a water management system that helps schools or senior centers efficiently monitor and conserve water usage, promoting sustainability in their everyday activities?*

---

## 📖 Project Overview

**AquaWise** is a smart, scalable, and user-friendly water management solution designed specifically for schools and senior centers. It empowers institutions to monitor, analyze, and reduce water usage using real-time insights, predictive AI, and gamified engagement.

Our goal is to foster sustainability by making water consumption **visible, actionable, and educational**.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Monitor water usage in real-time (using IoT or simulation).
- Provide actionable insights and alerts using AI.
- Engage students and elderly residents through gamification.
- Promote water conservation in a fun, educational way.
